-- Aura Balloon Co. — Supabase one-time setup
--
-- Run this once in your Supabase project: Dashboard -> SQL Editor -> New query
-- -> paste this whole file -> Run. Safe to re-run (uses "if not exists" /
-- drops policies before recreating them).
--
-- What this does:
--   1. Creates a `products` table (one row per balloon item).
--   2. Turns on Row Level Security so the rules below are actually enforced.
--   3. Lets anyone READ products (so the public site can show them).
--   4. Lets only a LOGGED-IN user (you, via the admin page) WRITE products.
--   5. Creates a public image bucket for product photos with the same
--      read-everyone / write-only-if-logged-in rule.

-- Orders table — one row per checkout or custom-order submission.
